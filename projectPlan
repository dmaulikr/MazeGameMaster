Project plan:

Status at the end of phase 1:
We have a maze class with a person, obstacles, and resources, along with an array of maze-cells. It will have internal functionality for moving the person around and storing how many resources a person has.
We will also have a main scene with two 'frames', one displaying a subset of the maze centered on the person which updates as the person moves, and one for displaying resources (not fully functional).
When the person walks over a resource their resource total increases, and when they encounter an obstacle an obstacle scene launches (currently it is not a functional obstacle).

Phase 2:
End with a minimally playable game. There will be a level selector and all the scenes and classes will interact properly.
However there will be few (probably only one) obstacle and resource and their locations will be hard coded. THere will probably be at most two levels.
Week one: Get the maze scene talking to the resource scene so that we can display accurate resource information. Enhance obstacle functionality, and document the code base.
Week two: Create a level selector and expand resource interaction to allow the resource scene to tell the maze scene when a resource is used. The level selector will open on launch, have an exit button, and be returned to on completion of the maze.
Week three: Create at least one obstacle and resource that function. 

Phase 3:
This phase we will add more obstacles, and the additional features we want to include which are not essential to game play.
Week one: Add more obstacles, resources, and levels. At least one, preferably more, of each.
Week two: Implement semi-random placement of obstacles and resources, continue adding obstacles and resources. 
Week three: Polish existing obstacles and such, if time permits implement health.

USER STORIES INCLUDED BELOW:

Epic 1: As a frequent flyer, I want the game to be fun to reply. 
Epic 2: As a player I want the maze to have challenging obstacles to keep the maze interesting.


Overall Design:
1. As a plane passenger, I’d like the game to be offline so that I can play it with the device in airplane mode. 
13. As somebody traveling for long periods of time, I was discrete levels so that I can take breaks.
27. As an experienced player, I want to be able to start on harder levels, so that I don’t get bored on early levels. 
As (I’m not sure who) I want the game to restart at the beginning of the level and not pause. 

Main Display:
3. As a tired plane passenger I want the main view of the maze to be large so that I don’t have to squint to see the maze and what is in it.
7. As a player I want to be able to tell if I what resources I have available on the main view so I don’t have to constantly switch between tabs.

Resources:
4. As an explorer, I want there to be resources hidden in the maze to incentivize exploring.
20. As someone who gets mad when I am one wall away from the exit/finish, I want a pickaxe so I can demolish the wall. 
21. As a user who wants to be challenged I want obstacles to be single use so that I have to manage my resources.
As someone who wants the levels to be completely separate I don’t want resources to roll over from previous levels.

Obstacles:
5. As a player who likes to be challenged I want there to be obstacles so that this isn’t just a maze navigation game.
6. As a player, I was obstacles to be randomized so each play through is different. 
14. As a new player, I want obstacles to be easier/fewer on low levels. 
19. As someone struggling with obstacles, I want resources to help me solve them. 
22. As someone who gets frustrated, I want to be able to exit an obstacle without solving it so that I can keep playing. 
23. As someone who likes balanced games, I want skipping obstacles to cost health so that you are discouraged from doing so. 

Obstacle Ideas:
4. As a fan of Indiana Jones I want there to be a pit obstacle which can be overcome by using a rope to swing across the pit.
5. As a fan of logic puzzles I want there to be a lock obstacle which makes you either smash the lock, hurting yourself, or solve a logic puzzle.
1. As someone who likes simon I want there to be a simon based obstacle.
2. As someone who is bad at simon I want a notepad resource so I can write down the pattern and pass the simon obstacle more easily.
Cave-in: need to drag boulders (which can't overlap) to clear a path (marked by an outline on the screen).
Fill in the pit: drag a boulder to fill in the pit so you cna get across.
