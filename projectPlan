Project plan:
At the end of the first three weeks:
-have a maze that is displaying on the main screen
-have the character, obstacles, and resources all marked in different colors on the maze
-Let the player navigate the maze based on user input
-Have obstacles pop up an 'obstacle view' (no puzzle, just have to click or swipe to dismiss)
-Have obstacles and resources go away after passing through
-have resources increase a counter displayed in the resources region of the screen
-Stretch goal is to have yarn working.

End of 2nd phase:
-Have a lvl selector that opens on launch, with a working exit button
-Have going through the exit of the maze take you back to the lvl selector
-Have yarn working
-Have at least one actual resource and obstacle

By the end of project:
-Have multiple levels
-Be placing the obstacles semi randomly in the levels
-Have more obstacles and resources
-Have maze overview and the maze view only show part of the maze
-Have health and score keeping



USER STORIES INCLUDED BELOW:

Epic 1: As a frequent flyer, I want the game to be fun to reply. 
Epic 2: As a player I want the maze to have challenging obstacles to keep the maze interesting.


Overall Design:
1. As a plane passenger, I’d like the game to be offline so that I can play it with the device in airplane mode. 
13. As somebody travelling for long periods of time, I was discrete levels so that I can take breaks.
27. As an experienced player, I want to be able to start on harder levels, so that I don’t get bored on early levels. 

Main Display:
2. As a player who likes to be challenged I don’t want to see the entire maze at once on the screen so I have to remember and explore some.
3. As a tired plane passenger I want the main view of the maze to be large so that I don’t have to squint to see the maze and what is in it.
7. As a player I want to be able to tell if I have yarn or other resources available on the main view so I don’t have to constantly switch between tabs.
8. As an explorer I want an overview map showing where I have been, so I can see what areas of the maze I have and haven’t explored.
9. As someone who wants to be challenged I don’t want an overview map that lets me see bits of the maze I haven’t yet explored, so I can’t just find the easiest path through the maze really quickly.

Resources:
4. As an explorer, I want there to be resources hidden in the maze to incentivize exploring.
10. As someone who gets lost, I want to be able to use yarn to mark where I have been so I can tell where I have been.
11. As someone who accidently goes in loops I want to be able to follow yarn (undo) and realize when I was in a loop. 
12. As someone who has finally figured out what is going on in an area I want to be able to collect yarn without backtracking so I can move on without tediously retracing my steps twice.
20. As someone who gets mad when I am one wall away from the exit/finish, I want a pickaxe so I can demolish the wall. 
21. As a user who wants to be challenged I want a pick axe to be damaged after being used to demolish a wall so that I can’t just carve a path through the maze and around all the obstacles.

Obstacles:
5. As a player who likes to be challenged I want there to be obstacles so that this isn’t just a maze navigation game.
6. As a player, I was obstacles to be randomized so each playthrough is different. 
14. As a new player, I want obstacles to be easier/fewer on low levels. 
19. As someone struggling with obstacles, I want resources to help me solve them. 
22. As someone who gets frustrated, I want to be able to pass an obstacle without solving it so that I can keep playing. 
23. As someone who likes balanced games, I want skipping obstacles to cost health so that you are discouraged from doing so. 


Scoring:
24. As a player who works hard to pass all the obstacles without losing health I want my score to be higher if I have high health.
25. As a person travelling with family I want there to be no penalty for playing slowly so I can play slowly while talking with my family.
27. As an explorer I want there to be a score bonus for exploring a level really thoroughly.

More Stories (yet to be inserted in priority/category):
As someone who plays this game frequently I want to keep track of my high score.
As a fan of Indiana Jones I want there to be a pit obstacle which can be overcome by using a rope to swing across the pit.
As a fan of logic puzzles I want there to be a lock obstacle which makes you either smash the lock, hurting yourself, or solve a logic puzzle.
As someone who likes simon I want there to be a simon based obstacle.
As someone who is bad at simon I want a notepad resource so I can write down the pattern and pass the simon obstacle more easily.
As someone who wants the game to be difficult I want notepads to have a limited number of uses so you eventually have to either play simon or find a new notepad.
As a fan of minesweeper I would like a minesweeper based obstacle.
As someone bad at minesweeper I would like a long stick item to allow me to check squares before I click them in minesweeper, thus surviving setting of a bomb.
As someone who wants the levels to be completely separate I don’t want resources to roll over from previous levels.
As (I’m not sure who) I want the game to restart at the beginning of the level and not pause.
